CR(edanaher):

This branch contains a bunch of CR(edanaher) comments indicating my code review.  Comments appear in typical
comment fashion above the relevant code, rather than the typical CR-style of below the code.

Logging seems inconsistent.  Could make troubleshooting painful.

Having a return after error error case seems like a waste of lines.  Stupid Go.

Lots of "might there be other types of errors" comments; we don't have to check all of them, but it's
misleading to give back "repository not found" when the image is there, but there was a 500 from Amazon
trying to delete the image.  Either be more precise in checking or less specific in the message ("Image not
found or other error deleting image")

Lots of missed opportunities for "if err := f(); err != nil";  I marked the first few.
